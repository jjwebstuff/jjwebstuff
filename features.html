                <h2 class="big-h2-heading company-color-text margintop20">Why We’re Different</h2>
                <p>
                    JJ Web Stuff is different from other web development houses for a few reasons. First, we’re all about workflow. Our relentless focus on how we do things makes our process fast and productive, which translates to lower development costs. Second, we cheat. We use templates to help give you a sense of what your site will look like and then we customize it. This is much more effective than paying a web guru $125 an hour for a design you don’t like. Third, communication. We desire constant feedback from our clients and provide steady status updates so you always know where we are in the development lifecycle.

                <h2 class="big-h2-heading company-color-text margintop20">Our Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Our process is straight-forward. We use collaboration tools to make it convenient for you to meet with us virtually or we can meet you in person if you’re in the Chicago area. Whether in person or virtually, the process is the same:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We take your company name (or ideas for a name) and seek out a handful of urls for you to choose from. (Or we searching until we find one you do like or our fingers turn to stumps. Whichever happens first)</li>
                        <li>We send you cutting edge templates to browse through to get an idea of what you like. You select and we put it into action.</li>    
                        <li>We talk about the content you're looking to have on the site. We'll develop the content together through collaboration tools.</li>
                        <li>Once the content has been finalized, we'll look into acquiring some stock imagery to flesh out the page or drop in pictures you already have. We'll also add any personalization you need.</li>
                        <li>We go over the final product, make any last minute changes or adjustments and launch your site.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    We handle all of your hosting and domain registration needs. We also offer a maintenance package for small changes ot the site that you might need.
