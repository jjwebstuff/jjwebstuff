At JJ Web Stuff, we didn't want to just be another web design company. There are plenty of good design firms out there doing extrodinary work.  We are more interested in helping the average small business owner tackle this big monstrous thing we call the World Wide Web.

Most small business owners don't have time to address their company's digital needs appropriately. Business owners are too busy being the president, accountant, human resources and inventory manager to tackle things like their digital footprint.  But the web holds tremendous power and opportunity for those small business owners who figure out a way to use it to their advantage. That's where JJ Web Stuff wants to step-in.

Not only do we want to help you get your company on the web, but we want to help you **use** the web and use it properly. Sites like [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) and even [FourSquare](http://www.foursquare.com) can help to grow your business, but if you don't manage those relationships and conversations that are taking place on the web, you lose control of your digital reputation.

We think it's important for **all** companies, regardless of size, to have someone guiding them through the hurldes and pitfalls of the web.  We don't want to just get you on the web, we want to help you through it.
